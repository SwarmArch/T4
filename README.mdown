# T4: Compiling Sequential Code for Effective Speculative Parallelization in Hardware

Code and instructions for getting started with the T4 compiler will be added to this repository by June 1, 2020,
which is the date at which our paper was to be presented at ISCA 2020.
As the conference format has changed due to COVID-19,
the conference talk has been recorded and is already available to view to conference attendees on Whova.
If you are interested in learning more, please see the video talk and attend the live Q&A session
for the the first paper in session 2B of ISCA 2020.
